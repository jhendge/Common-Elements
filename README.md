Common Elements
===============

Write a function that finds and prints the common elements in two unsorted arrays. 

For instance, if ```array1 = [70, 5, 27, -2, 14]``` and ```array2 = [-2, 8, 66, 14]``` the function should spit out ```[-2, 14]```

There are many ways to do this, some more clever than others!
